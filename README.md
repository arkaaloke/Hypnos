Hypnos : Unobtrusive power proportionality for Torque clusters
======

This repo contains code for unobtrusive power management of large Torque clusters. 
Unobtrusive power management implies 
(1) It should not require any modification of the existing Torque setup
(2) It uses only existing Torque interfaces
(3) It is defensive and tries to ensure fault-tolerance to problems arising out of power cycling servers.
(4) Easy to turn on or off.
